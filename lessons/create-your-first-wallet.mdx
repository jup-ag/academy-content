Let’s walk through creating your first self-custodial wallet with Jupiter.

1. install the Jupiter app, available both on Apple App Store and the Google Play store.

=> instructions

2. Your wallet will have generated your private keys, and your seed phrase (which comes in the form of 12 or 24 words). For all intents and purposes, the private keys and the seed phrase do the same thing.

3. This is the most important part - keeping your seed phrase safe.
- Do not take a screenshot, or copy & paste this information on your laptop or phone.
- Write down the seed phrase with pen and paper. Please take note that the order of the words matter.
- Store your seed phrase somewhere safe. Even better, consider writing out another copy and storing it in more than 1 secure place.
- If you’re in a public area, do wait until you are in a private room. You can always go back to the extension or the app to review your seed phrase.


4. Jupiter will now confirm your back-up and ask you to re-enter the seed phrase. Take your time.

Remember: keep your seed phrase safe, offline in a secure place. Do not share this with anyone.

And voila! You now have your very first crypto wallet! Congratulations, you’ve taken your first real step into the crypto space.

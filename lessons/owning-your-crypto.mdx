## What Does Self-Custody Mean?
In the fiat world, when you deposit money in a bank, the bank holds it for you. You trust them to keep it safe, and you also trust them to give you access to your money when you need it. In crypto, many people embody the idea of self‑custody.

Self‑custody means you hold on to your crypto directly, without relying on a bank or exchange. It’s very similar to cold-hard cash: you are in direct control, can spend it whenever & wherever you want, and payments move directly without an intermediary (i.e. peer-to-peer).

## The Importance of Private Keys
How do you prove that you own this money? In traditional banking, you would show some identification at the bank, or input your login credentials online. In crypto, ownership is proven by something called a private key.

This key gives you *full and exclusive access to your money*. To make it easier, a recovery phrase or seed phrase is typically provided - usually in the form of a string of 12 or 24 words. 

Here’s the important part:
- Whoever has the private key, controls the funds.
- Share it, and someone else can take your money.
- Lose it, and no institution can restore access. It’s lost forever. 
- Protect them like you would the keys to your home.

Self‑custody is both empowering and serious work. It means you are your own bank. You decide how to store, move, and use your funds. And while that freedom is exciting, it also means practicing good security habits from day one. Just like cash, if you lose it, no one’s gonna be able to help you.

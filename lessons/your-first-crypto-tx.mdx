Let’s understand & practice some of the the fundamentals of crypto transactions

## What is a Stablecoin?
Stablecoins are specific cryptocurrencies that are, by design, pegged to other familiar assets. One of the most popular stablecoins is the USD Coin, also known as USDC, which is pegged to the US Dollar 1:1.

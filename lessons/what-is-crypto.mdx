Let’s spend some time breaking down what cryptocurrency really is.

## Currency vs Cryptocurrency
Ultimately, crypto is just digital money. Like fiat, it represents value, just like the dollar or the pound. The main difference is that while fiat is managed by governments & central banks, crypto is managed by code run on a global network. 

## Define: “Crypto”
The term "crypto" is short for cryptography, the use of advanced coding and mathematical techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new information. 
This underlying technology enables a form of digital currency - dubbed ‘cryptocurrency’ - that operates on a decentralized system, independent of traditional financial institutions like banks or governments. 

## What is a “Blockchain”
You probably have heard of Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency. When Bitcoin was launched in 2009, it was built on the novel concept of the blockchain. 

Think of your bank account: the bank is the only one who keeps records of your money and transactions. Crypto does the same thing, except this list of records is publicly shared & verified across thousands, if not tens of thousands of computers. This network of computers is an example of the blockchain. 

The blockchain is precisely why crypto remains so secure. Because these records are distributed across a large, open-source network, no single company, country, or third-party is in control of it. 

Anyone can join in & participate in the blockchain, which is constantly updating and recording all transactions for that currency. That is the power of the blockchain - this is also why cryptocurrencies are often described as “decentralized”.

## What is a “Token”
A crypto token represents a digital asset built on a blockchain. While many tokens exist to represent monetary value, other tokens may represent reward, utility, security, governance, etc., offering a wide range of versatile functions beyond just payment. 

To clarify, using Bitcoin & as an example:
- Blockchain: Bitcoin is the name of the blockchain technology 
- Native token: Bitcoin is also the name of the native token, which holds monetary value and exists within the Bitcoin blockchain
- There are other crypto tokens (i.e. stable coins, meme coins, NFTs), that also exist on the Bitcoin blockchain that serve a multitude of other purposes.

## Comparing Blockchains
Bitcoin was the first blockchain, but it wasn’t long before other prominent blockchains entered the scene. Here are the big 3 blockchains and their comparisons to each other.

## Uses of Cryptocurrency
- Pay or tip for goods & services, especially with more and more merchants accepting various cryptocurrencies
- Send money to your family halfway across the world - instantly
- Borrow and lend money without the need of a central bank
- Many cryptocurrencies offer rewards simply for holding those currencies
- Many platforms also allow you to earn interest, just like a regular savings account
- A means of investment, where you can buy stocks, derivatives, stablecoins, and other tokens

To sum up - we’ve covered what exactly is cryptocurrency and its uses. For many, crypto is not a means to completely replace fiat, but rather, a way to expand upon what money can do for you.

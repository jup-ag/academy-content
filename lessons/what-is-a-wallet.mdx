In the fiat world, a wallet is where you keep your cash & cards. In crypto, a wallet is something that stores your private keys - the direct proof of ownership. Without those keys, you can’t access your crypto. Your wallet is more than storage; it’s your link to the blockchain.

Custodial Wallets vs Self-Custodial Wallets
There are two main types of wallets. Custodial wallets, like those offered by crypto exchanges like Binance & Coinbase hold your keys for you. It’s convenient, but it means you’re trusting someone else - exactly like leaving your money in a bank. Then there are self‑custodial wallets, where you hold the keys yourself. That’s true ownership, and it’s why many people prefer them."

The Public Key of a Wallet
Each Jupiter wallet comprises of 1 public key, and 1 private key set of keys
(wallet address = public key)
The public key (also known as the wallet address) is a unique, shareable identifier, and looks like a long string of characters, typically 32 - 44 long. In traditional banking, it’s similar to your bank account number. You can safely share this information with your friends, which allows them to:
Look up the public information associated with the wallet, including account value & past transactions, 
Transfer funds directly into the wallet. This public key does not give them permissions to make any transactions or mess around with the wallet contents. 

Keeping your Wallet Safe
The public key (or wallet address) is safe to share with your friends and family.
The private keys are NOT safe to share. Here’s a quick safety checklist:
Always back up your recovery phrase
Never share it with anyone
Don’t store your private keys online
And treat your wallet like the keys to your home - guard it carefully.
